# React + Vite

To run this in your local, clone this repo and run the following commands:
   - Install the required dependencies using npm:
    
    ```
    npm install
    ```
   
  - Start the development server to run the application locally:
    
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address). You can access the application in your web browser.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
